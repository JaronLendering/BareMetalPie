# BareMetalPie

## Prerequisites
This repository is made for the Raspberry Pi 4B, using
<a href="https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads">aarch64-none-elf 14.3</a>  as cross compiler, with Ubuntu as development operating system.

## File Structure
### BareMinimum
In BareMinimum, I will put highly documented code (mostly in the form of comments) of simple implementations for a UART connection and a blinking action light. This can be used as a easy to understand starting point if you do not want to follow an exact tutorial.
